## Project Description
The Pokémon Battle Game is an interactive web application designed to simulate Pokémon battles. Users can select their Pokémon from a dropdown menu, which then displays the selected Pokémon's information. Once the user is ready, they can initiate a battle against a computer-controlled opponent. The game includes a battle log that details each round of the fight until a winner is determined.
